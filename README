Pez is a small, lightweight, 100% C (for now), embeddable or standalone,
public domain, portable dialect of Forth.  It is based on the Atlast
system (see doc/CREDITS for more information).

The primary goal of the Pez project, much like the goal of the Atlast
project, is to bring dead-simple scriptability and dynamism to otherwise
static code, with a focus on user-level scripting of applications.
There are a number of compile-time options for trimming down and
limiting in the case of untrusted input, and also a large number of
OS-level facilities both added and planned.

I highly recommend having a look at doc/atlast.pdf, written by Mr.
Walker in 1990, especially the introduction which is still shockingly
relevant now, about 20 years later.

There are a number of benefits to adding user-level scripting to an
application.  You get a free doman-specific language to expose to users
however you see fit.  You get a free configuration file parser in the
same language as your application's DSL.  You get a dynamic internal
scripting language a la LUA.  You get a safe, plain-text, cross-platform
language for communicating between your applications.  It can even be
used as a complete, full-featured standalone language.  And it's
lightweight to boot:  running on a 64-bit Linux, I'm looking at about 568k
of memory for the REPL for a full system.

Pez has added to the Atlast system a number of features:
* Portability to 64-bit platforms
* A Foreign Function Interface, for dynamically loading libraries to interface
  with system libraries.
* More complete access to standard system calls, such as fork(), exec(),
  etc.
* Numerous small improvements, and more large improvements on the way.  See
  doc/TODO.

I certainly hope that you find this codebase to be as useful and as much
fun as I have.

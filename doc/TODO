This is a sort of unordered roadmap for Pez.

NOW

* Misc cleanup

* Structs.

* Finish up the socket library, once structs are solidified.

* Include more batteries.  Flesh out core.pez.

* Add support for hashes, via st_hash (public domain).

* Use flags in the interpreter struct instead of #define's for features
  to support or disallow.  The basics have been set up, but are not
  implemented.

* Restructure the dictionary, so that flags are no longer stored in the
  first byte of the name field.

* Finalize the API for a Pez interpreter instantiated by another Pez
  program, so that the above-mentioned jailing of sub-pez's makes sense.

LATER

* Serialization of the dictionary/code/etc.
	* I expect text to be easier than binary images.
	* Also, do both if possible.

* Maybe get rid of the case-insensitivity and turn everything lower-case;
  depends on how much of a pain that turns out to be.

MUCH LATER

* Investigate a few key optimizations, as I'm planning on using Pez as a VM
  language, especially for Roboto.

* Along those lines, there are a few Roboto features that may be pushed down to
  Pez, although this will only happen where it does not interfere with Pez as a
  general-purpose standalone language or embedded scripting language.

%       Technical Report style definition

%       Designed and implemented by John Walker in September of 1989

%       This   is   used  as  an  optional  argument  to  the  article
%       documentstyle, and is normally used in  conjunction  with  the
%       article documentstyle in:

%       \documentstyle[aitech]{article}

%       The  following  declarations  are permitted, shown with sample
%       arguments in the recommended format.

%       \title{Killer Slugs From Ukiah}
%       \abstract{Just when you thought it was safe to go back
%                 into the garden.}
%       \author{Kelvin R. Throop}
%       \date{July 20, 1989}

%       You may omit the following declarations, which will then assume
%       the following defaults:

%       Declaration       Default
%       ===========       =======

%       abstract          No abstract supplied.
%       date              \today

%       Since  this  style  is  intended  solely  for  in-house use at
%       Autodesk where we use ArborText's TeX release  and  PostScript
%       printers  exclusively, this style uses an ArborText PostScript
%       font, "psmtimr" for the title and dropped  capitals.   If  you
%       want  to  use  this  style and don't have access to PostScript
%       fonts, you'll have to change the font declarations that appear
%       at the very bottom of this file.


%       We  redefine  the  \maketitle command to display things in our
%       format and also to cause the first page to be formatted  as  a
%       normal odd page.

\renewcommand{\maketitle}{
\twocolumn[
\vspace*{-0.5in}
\begin{center}
{\titlefont \@title} \\
\vspace{6pt} \parbox{6.5in}{\Large \sl \@abstract } \\
\vspace{8pt} {\large by \@author} \\
{\large \@date}
\end{center}
]
}

%       Define defaults for optional declarations

\def\@abstract{No abstract supplied.}

%       Include other styles implicitly used

\input{dcap.sty}

%       Define commands for style-defined declarations

\renewcommand{\abstract}[1]{\def\@abstract{#1}}

%       Define command for dense-packed lists

\newcommand{\dense}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-1ex}}

%       Declare formatting modes

\topmargin -0.5in
\textheight 9in
\parskip 10pt
\parindent 0pt
\oddsidemargin -0.25in
\evensidemargin -0.25in
\textwidth 7in

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{-1}       % Disable section numbering
\setcounter{tocdepth}{-1}          % Disable table of contents

%       Font  declarations.   See the comment in the heading about the
%       use of ArborText DVIPS PostScript fonts.  If  you  don't  have
%       access  to these fonts, you'll have to change the font name in
%       the next two declarations to something your TeX does  support.
%       Unfortunately,  the  standard  CM  fonts  available  with most
%       versions of TeX provide nothing ideal for letters this  large.
%       Try  "cmr17" at the specified point sizes; it's about the best
%       you can do unless you have local custom fonts.

% \newfont{\titlefont}{cmr17 at 36pt}
% \dcapfont{cmr17 at 32pt}

\newfont{\titlefont}{rptmr at 36pt}
\dcapfont{rptmr at 32pt}
